## Portfolio App
This is a single-page application portfolio designed for a web developer. The app showcases the developer’s work and provides an interactive experience for visitors. It is built using React, TypeScript, and Vite, and styled with Semantic UI React. The application includes sections for About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, with smooth, dynamic navigation and client-side validation.

## Features
Single-Page Navigation:
Visitors can switch between sections (About Me, Portfolio, Contact, Resume) without a full page reload. The navigation menu highlights the active section.

## About Me Section:
Displays the developer’s recent photo or avatar along with a short biography.

## Portfolio Section:
Showcases six projects with titled images. Each project includes links to the deployed application and its corresponding GitHub repository.

## Contact Section:
Provides a contact form with fields for the visitor’s name, email address, and message. Form validation ensures that required fields are filled in and that the email is in the correct format.

## Resume Section:
Offers a downloadable resume link and a list of the developer’s technical proficiencies.

## Footer:
Includes links or icons that direct visitors to the developer’s GitHub, LinkedIn, and other professional profiles.

## Technology Stack
Frontend: React with TypeScript
Build Tool: Vite
Styling: Semantic UI React and custom CSS, using a consistent color palette
Routing & State Management: React’s built-in state and conditional rendering
Single-Page Application (SPA): All content is dynamically loaded and managed on one page for a seamless user experience
Setup & Installation
Clone the Repository:
Download the project files from the GitHub repository to your local machine.

## Install Dependencies:
Use npm (or yarn) to install all required dependencies for the project.

## Configure the Environment:
Ensure that your development environment is properly set up to work with React, TypeScript, and Vite. Semantic UI CSS is included as a dependency.

## Start the Application:
Launch the development server using the provided npm scripts. The application will open in your default browser as a single-page interface.

## Usage
When the portfolio loads for the first time, the About Me section is displayed by default. Users can click on navigation titles to view the Portfolio, Contact, or Resume sections. The active section is highlighted in the navigation menu. In the Portfolio section, visitors can explore projects by clicking on images and following links to see deployed applications and GitHub repositories. In the Contact section, form fields validate input to ensure that all required data is provided correctly. The Resume section offers a link for downloading a resume and displays a list of technical skills.

## Development
The project is built as a modern SPA using Vite and React with TypeScript. The application structure is modular, with separate components for navigation, header, footer, and project listings. Styling is managed with Semantic UI React, integrated with a custom color scheme.

## Troubleshooting
Single-Page Navigation Issues:
Ensure that the navigation state is properly managed and that components re-render as expected when switching sections.

Styling Problems:
Verify that Semantic UI CSS is correctly imported and that custom styles are applied as intended.

Build & Deployment:
Follow Vite’s documentation for troubleshooting build or hot-reload issues.
